Problem:  Group Shifted Strings
DS:  Hash map
Date: 19/07/2023

Detailed Problem: We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.

For example, "abc" can be shifted to be "bcd".
We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.

For example, we can keep shifting "abc" to form the sequence: "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz".
Given an array of strings strings, group all strings[i] that belong to the same shifting sequence. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: strings = ["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"]
Output: [["acef"],["a","z"],["abc","bcd","xyz"],["az","ba"]]
Example 2:

Input: strings = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
