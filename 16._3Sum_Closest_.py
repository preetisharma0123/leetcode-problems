Problem: 3Sum Closest
DS: 
Approach: binary search
Date:  31/07/2023
Detailed Problem:Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

Time Complexity:O(n2logn). Binary search takes O(log⁡n), and we do it n times in the inner loop. Since we are going through nnn elements in the outer loop, the overall complexity is O(n2log⁡n)
Space Complexity: O(logn) to O(n), depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm.
